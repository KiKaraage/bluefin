### Why 16 GB RAM?
Bluefin requires more memory than standard Fedora (2 GB minimum) due to:
- Integrated container development tools (Docker/Podman)

- GNOME desktop environment with modern features
- Multiple development environments and language servers
- System stability for professional workloads

*Based on upstream Fedora documentation with Bluefin-specific enhancements for cloud-native desktop computing.*
