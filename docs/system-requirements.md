# Bluefin System Requirements

This document outlines the minimum and recommended system requirements for running Bluefin, based on upstream Fedora documentation with adjustments for Bluefin's cloud-native desktop environment.

## Minimum Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- **Processor**: 64-bit x86_64 processor (Intel or AMD)
- **Memory (RAM)**: 16 GB RAM
- **Storage**: 64 GB available disk space
- **Graphics**: Any graphics card with basic display support
- **Network**: Internet connection for installation and updates

### Firmware Requirements
- **Boot**: UEFI firmware (BIOS mode supported but UEFI recommended)
- **Secure Boot**: Supported (optional)

## Recommended Requirements

For optimal performance and full feature utilization:

- **Processor**: Modern 64-bit multi-core processor (Intel Core i5/AMD Ryzen 5 or equivalent)
- **Memory (RAM)**: 32 GB RAM or more
- **Storage**: 128 GB SSD storage
- **Graphics**: Dedicated graphics card (Intel Arc, NVIDIA GeForce, AMD Radeon)
- **Network**: Broadband internet connection

## Why These Requirements?

Bluefin's requirements exceed standard Fedora minimums due to:

### Enhanced RAM Requirements (16 GB vs Fedora's 2 GB)
- **Container Workloads**: Integrated Docker/Podman support for development containers
- **Development Tools**: Multiple development environments and language servers
- **Cloud-Native Tools**: Kubernetes tooling, cloud CLI tools, and container orchestration
- **Desktop Environment**: GNOME desktop with modern compositing and effects
- **System Reliability**: Adequate memory for smooth multitasking and system stability

### Increased Storage Requirements
- **Atomic Updates**: OSTree-based system requiring additional space for atomic updates
- **Container Images**: Storage for development container images and applications
- **Flatpak Applications**: Sandboxed applications requiring additional space
- **User Data**: Development projects, documentation, and user files

## Special Considerations

### Development Workloads
If you plan to use Bluefin for intensive development work, consider:
- **RAM**: 32 GB+ for running multiple containers simultaneously
- **Storage**: Fast NVMe SSD for container I/O performance
- **CPU**: Higher core count for parallel builds and compilation

### Gaming (Bluefin with Gaming Additions)
For gaming workloads:
- **Graphics**: Dedicated GPU strongly recommended
- **RAM**: 16 GB minimum, 32 GB recommended for modern titles
- **Storage**: Fast SSD for game loading times

### Virtualization
If running virtual machines:
- **CPU**: Hardware virtualization support (Intel VT-x/AMD-V)
- **RAM**: Additional 8-16 GB per virtual machine
- **Storage**: Additional space for VM disk images

## Hardware Compatibility

Bluefin inherits hardware compatibility from Fedora Linux and includes additional drivers for:
- **NVIDIA Graphics**: Proprietary NVIDIA drivers included
- **Hardware Enablement**: HWE stack for newer hardware support
- **Surface Devices**: Microsoft Surface-specific optimizations available
- **ASUS Hardware**: ASUS-specific driver support available

## Upgrade Path

Users running systems below these requirements may experience:
- Slower performance during container operations
- Reduced multitasking capability
- Longer boot and application load times
- Potential system instability under heavy workloads

For systems with insufficient resources, consider:
1. Upgrading RAM to meet the 16 GB minimum
2. Using an SSD for improved I/O performance
3. Ensuring adequate cooling for sustained workloads
